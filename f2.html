            <h1>First Poet</h1>
            <p> Valmiki was the composer of the first Sanskrit poem (the Adikavya) known the world over as the epic
                Ramayana
                (Story of Lord Rama), hence he is called the Adikavi or First Poet - the Poet of Poets of India. He
                was born
                along the banks of the Ganges in ancient India to a sage by the name of Prachetasa. His birth name
                was
                Ratnakara. He apparently got lost in the jungles as a child and was found by a hunter who raised him
                as his
                own son. When he grew up he became a hunter like his foster father but also took to being a bandit
                to
                supplement his livelihood. Once it so happened he met the Maharishi Narada and tried to rob him.

            <h1>The first shloka</h1>
            <p> Valmiki was going to the river Ganges for his daily ablutions. A disciple by the name Bharadwaja was
                carrying his clothes. On the way, they came across the Tamasa Stream. Looking at the stream, Valmiki
                said to
                his disciple, "Look, how clear is this water, like the mind of a good man! I will bathe here today."
                When he
                was looking for a suitable place to step into the stream, he saw a crane couple mating. Valmiki felt
                very
                pleased on seeing the happy birds. Suddenly, hit by an arrow, the male bird died on the spot.</p>
